We made our home by the landfill
It's a risk, and the grounds slidesoften
We cleaned house and took a box to the Goodwill
But we pulled out these two reels:

"10, 000 Miles" and "From Rural Pakistan."

When we got home, we put them on
You spoke the language well
With your Vedic slant
Your voice is gone
