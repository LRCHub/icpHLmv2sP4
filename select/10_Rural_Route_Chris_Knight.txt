I built a fire up on the hill; I sat in the woods and drank my fill
Talked to God all night, took another shot at setting me right
Then I walked down to the road, filled a beer can full of 22 holes
Then I said goodbye, yeah I said goodbye
I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone ? At my mothers' house
And all the lights are out, down on the rural route
There ain't much of nothin' left, this place where I became myself
Ghosts and memories, I'd walk on by but they'd follow me
I'd seen plenty on down the road. Asked him if he'd seen my brother
He just said no, well I guess I'd better go
I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone ? At my mothers' house
And all the lights are out, down on the rural route
I built a fire up on the hill; I sat in the woods and drank my fill
Talked to God all night, took another shot at setting me right
Then I'd just walk away, ain't nothin' here I want to remember anyway
Least not today
I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone ? At my mothers' house
And all the lights are out, down on the rural route
I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone ? At my mothers' house
And all the lights are out, down on the rural route
